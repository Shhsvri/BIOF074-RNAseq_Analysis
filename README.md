# BIOF074: RNA-seq Data Analysis and Visualization

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:-------------|:----------|
| Biologists | Basic R | 4-day workshop |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 4-day Introduction to bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. The
workshop focuses on teaching basic skills to use the command line interface, specifically `bash`, dowstream analysis in R,
and the use of publicly available datasets.

- [Syllabus](Syllabus_May22.pdf)


### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash/shell).
1.	Perform RNA sequencing alignment and differential expression analysis.
1.	explore scRNAseq data and analyze using Seurat
1.	Access and use publicly available datasets.
